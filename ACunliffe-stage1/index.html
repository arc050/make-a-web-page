      <div class="notes">
        <p>The web is a collection of HTML documents. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is the main type of document on the web. The major pieces to the web start with us on our browser. The browser makes HTTP requests to the internet that goes to the server and the server sends back the web page you wish to browse through the internet.</p>

    <div class="header"><h3>HTML is made up of:</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <ol>text content: what you see</ol>
        <ol>markup: what it looks like</ol>
        <ol>references to other documents: i.e..images & videos</ol>
        <ol>links to other pages: websites, compose email</ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header"><h3>HTML Tags:</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <ol>b = bold</ol>
        <ol>em = emphasis/italics</ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header"><h3>HTML Attributes:</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <ol>href: the value of an anchor tag that links the media to the html document.</ol>
        <ol>src: the value of an image tag that links the image to the html document.</ol>
        <ol>alt: the value of the alternate text displayed in the image tag if the image won't load.</ol>
        <ol>Image tags are called void tags since they don't have any content which is why they don;t require a closing tag.</ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header"><h3>Whitespace:</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <ol>br = allows you to create a new line of text in html.</ol>
        <ol>p = allows you to create a paragraph of content in html.</ol>
      </div>
    <div>

    <div class="header"><h3>Inline and Block Elements</h3>
      <div class="notes">
        <ol>A, span, br, img, and strong are all inline elements because they don't generate a box around the content like a block elements does when you use p, div, or form.</ol>  
      </div>
    </div>

        <ol>HTML is the standard markup language used to create webpages.</ol>
        <ol>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is the language for how the page looks and is styled.</ol>
        <ol>DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM is a cross-platform and language independent convention for representing and interacting with the elements in HTML. DOM gives the elements in HTML the tree like structure.</ol>

  <div class="title"><h1>Adding Style to Structure with CSS</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <div class="notes">
        <ol>CSS are rules for an HTML document to abide by that changes the format and style of all the elements in the page.</ol>
        <ol>Selectors in the CSS are how you can change the rules to a specific element in a webpage.</ol>
        <ol>A declaration is a line of code that controls the "background-color"(property) and the color "black"(value of that property).</ol>
        <ol>Adding a class selector allows you to be more specific when dealing with multiple elements that are the same and want to style them separately.</ol>
        <ol>To add a CSS style page to your html document you have to reference it in the head of your webpage.</ol>
